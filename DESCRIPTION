Description: 
  Provides functions for the power normal distribution (PND) and its 
  multivariate extension (MVPND), including density, distribution 
  function, quantile function, and random generation. Reparametrized 
  versions are also implemented using interpretable scale and location 
  parameters based on the median and interquantile range, as proposed 
  by Maruo et al. (2017). Useful for statistical modeling and simulation 
  involving right-skewed continuous variables.
